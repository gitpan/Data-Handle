 [00 Important Changes]
 - Code has been purged of stolen chunks of Carp code, and now instead depends on a minimum Carp of v1.22. This is the
   first release of Carp that was packaged on CPAN as a Dual Lifed module, upon which I can rely upon the existance and
   implementation of 'caller_info'. It is hoped this will make bugs smaller and the code easier.

0.01011702 2010-12-21T13:43:35Z
 - Distribution Change only. Otherwise identical to previous release.
 - Don't index DB.

0.01011701 2010-12-21T13:29:00Z
 - Give up on trying to operate with the Carp shipped with 5.6.2. If its not there, and not in Carp::Heavy's
   injections, use a copy of one we stole and made work.
 - Have to put a fix in as well, because Term::ANSIColor clobbers $@

0.01011617 2010-12-21T05:46:24Z
 - Fix "missing parentheses around my ( )" for Perl-5.6

0.01011601 2010-12-20T13:07:01Z
 - Yuck. The way caller_info is provided is ambiguous. Hopefully this release will get that right.

0.01011501 2010-12-19T13:15:59Z
 - The method we were borrowing out of Carp wasn't there in old versions, so we've added a bit of magic to try get it
   from older carps too, so we don't fail on <= 5.10.1 :(

0.01011500 2010-12-19T12:36:06Z
 - More tests to improve general function coverage.
 - 'generate_exception' is gone, depercated.
 - Replace: C< generate_exception($class , $message)->throw() > with C< _gen_tree($full_class)->throw( $message ) >
 - Coverage testing detected a missing exception class, fixed in this release.
 - All tied() methods now tested to some degree to work.

0.01011421 2010-12-19T09:52:17Z
 - Reworked the Exception code to be cleaner at the cost of a slight initialisatin cost.
 - Reworked code bodies to unify seek/tell calls as _restore_pos and _set_pos.
 - Added _fh so internal code is less confusing.
 - Extended tests to cover more scenarios.
 - Added contributed suggestions as "alternative_techinques" with demonstrations how they *( so far ) don't work. If
   people can get them to work (on all perls), that'd be great!. ( Seems there are many weird fdup bugs in perl )
 - Stolen the backtrace code from Carp a bit and augmented it, now produce useful backtraces.
 - Have some nice code in our exception stringification that highlights lines with colours based on how much we think
   they're related to the problem. Stuff thats part of DH ( the place the error was detected ) is highlighted green as
   we think it will be usefull in diagnosis, but its not the source of the problem. Stuff that we know is likely to be
   infrastructural and not likely to be part of the problem ( ie: code like Try::Tiny and Test::Fatal ) are highlighted
   yellow because we doubt its useful. Everything else is left white, and you should look for the problem there first.
